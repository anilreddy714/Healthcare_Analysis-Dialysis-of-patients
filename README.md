# Healthcare_Analysis-Dialysis-of-patients
my latest project in the Healthcare domain, "Dialysis of Patients." project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive This dataset, Dialysis - I & Dialysis - II, which contains over 7,000 records in each CSV file. Throughout this endeavor, I explored several key performance indicators (KPIs) to uncover valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.
Some notable KPIs include:

1.Number of Patients across various summaries: Gain a deeper understanding of patient distribution across different categories.

2 Profit vs. Non-Profit Stats: Examine the financial aspects and compare performance between profit and non-profit entities.

3 Chain Organizations w.r.t. Total Performance Score as No Score: Assess the performance of chain organizations in relation to their total performance score.

4 Dialysis Stations Stats: Analyze and visualize key metrics related to dialysis stations to identify trends and patterns.

5 # of Category Text - As Expected: Determine the expected number of category texts and evaluate their impact on the overall dataset.

6 Average Payment Reduction Rate: Calculate and track the average rate at which nayments are reduced
